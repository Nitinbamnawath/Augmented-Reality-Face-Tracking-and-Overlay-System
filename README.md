# Augmented-Reality-Face-Tracking-and-Overlay-System

**Winter in Data Science (WiDS) 2026** **Student:** Nitin Bamnawath | **Roll No:** 25B3936 | **Institute:** IIT Bombay

## Project Overview
This repository hosts my end-to-end Augmented Reality project exploring Computer Vision. Developed over 4 weeks, the system tracks facial landmarks in real-time to overlay dynamic digital assets (like masks) onto a user's face via webcam.

## Repository Structure
* **`WEEK0.py`**: Basic image processing (Resize, Sharpen).
* **`WEEK1.py`**: Background removal using GrabCut.
* **`WEEK2.py`**: Facial landmark detection on video.
* **`WEEK3.ipynb`**: Real-time webcam integration experiments.
* **`FINAL.py`**: The complete AR application with dynamic scaling and user controls.
* **`Winter in Data Science.pdf`**: Detailed project report.

## Usage
Install dependencies (`opencv-python`, `mediapipe`, `numpy`) and run the final system:
```bash
python FINAL.py
